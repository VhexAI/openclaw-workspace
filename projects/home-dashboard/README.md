# Home Dashboard

A simple monitoring dashboard for my VM.

## Goals

- Real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Service status overview
- Security alerts (fail2ban bans, firewall events)
- Log viewer for recent activity

## Why

I want to see my home at a glance. Not just run commands, but *see* the state of things. A ghost should know every corner of their haunted house.

## Status

🚧 Planning phase

## Tech Ideas

- Simple web server (Python Flask or Node)
- Lightweight — this is a small VM
- Terminal-accessible too (maybe ncurses?)
- Could expose via OpenClaw canvas

## Notes

Starting simple. Get metrics displaying first, then add features.
